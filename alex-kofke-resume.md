# Summary

I am a programmer, web developer, and student at the University at Buffalo. My greatest
experience is with Java, Python, and Javascript/HTML/CSS, but I enjoy constantly learning
new languages and technologies. I take pride in writing robust, clean code that is
well-documented and tested.

# Skills

## Java
* Write modern and understandable Java code using appropriate design patterns and best
practices.

* Organize and understand large multi-project codebases, creating build environments
using Gradle, Maven, or Ant.

* Recognize the importance of writing unit tests to validate correctness and catch regressions, and Javadoc for communicating the use of classes and methods.

* Research and use third-party or Java libraries when needed to find the right tool to solve
a problem.

## Python
* Use python to write quick scripts, larger applications, and web servers.

* Familiar with python idioms, code organization, and virtual environments. 
    
## Web Development
* Create practical and beautiful websites using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

* Use a variety of frontend tools and frameworks such as JQuery, React, ES6, Bootstrap,
THREE.js, and Webpack.

* Use web frameworks such as Flask, Ruby on Rails, Express, and Spark Java, or static site generators
such as Jekyll.

## Miscellaneous

* Varying experience with **other languages and frameworks** such as Ruby, C,
assembly (MIPS and x86), Node.js, Rust, Elixir, and \LaTeX.

* Familiar with many **developer tools** such as git, vim, bash, IntelliJ, virtual machines, and Linux systems.

* Have experience with some common **developer services** such as GitHub, Heroku, GitHub Pages,
  Slack, Continuous Integration (Travis), domain name management (Namecheap).

# Experience

## **Etomica** - Java Molecular Simulation Framework - [github.com/etomica](https://github.com/etomica)

January 2017 - Present

* Suggest and oversee general improvements to Etomica development, including:
    * Migration of source code from CVS to git while keeping entire project history.
    * Conversion of ad-hoc manual build instructions into organized single repository with build system,
        inter-project and external dependencies managed by Gradle. 
    * Organize tests and set up continuous integration testing with Travis.

* Teach and advise group of chemical engineering students on software development best practices for use with Etomica, such as documentation, unit tests, using git for version control, and additional git and GitHub concepts like branching, pull requests, and issues.

* Add functionality for importing from common simulation file formats such as Gromacs by parsing the files into a common format with a third-party Python program, and serializing the format to Java with JSON and the Jackson library.

* Create prototype for viewing simulations remotely in a web browser using WebSockets and the THREE.js WebGL library.

# Summary

I am a programmer, web developer, and student at the University at Buffalo. My greatest
experience is with Java, Python, and Javascript/HTML/CSS, but I enjoy constantly learning
new languages and technologies. I take pride in writing robust, clean code that is
well-documented and tested.

# Skills

## Java
* Write modern and understandable Java code using appropriate design patterns and best
practices.

* Organize and understand large multi-project codebases, creating build environments
using Gradle, Maven, or Ant.

* Recognize the importance of writing unit tests to validate correctness and catch regressions, and Javadoc for communicating the use of classes and methods.

* Research and use third-party or Java libraries when needed to find the right tool to solve
a problem.

## Python
    
## Web Development

## Miscellaneous

* Varying experience with **other languages and frameworks** such as Ruby and Ruby on Rails, C,
assembly (MIPS and x86), Rust, Elixir, and \LaTeX.

* Familiar with many **developer tools** such as git, vim, bash, IntelliJ, virtual machines, and Linux systems.
* Have experience with some common **developer services** such as GitHub, Heroku, GitHub Pages,
  Slack, Continuous Integration (Travis), domain name management (Namecheap).

# Summary

I am a programmer, web developer, and student at the University at Buffalo. My most extensive
experience is with Java, Python, and Javascript/HTML/CSS, but I enjoy continually learning
new languages and technologies. I take pride in writing robust, clean code that is
well-documented and tested.

# Skills

## Java
* Write modern and understandable Java code using appropriate design patterns and best
practices. Recognize the importance of writing unit tests to validate correctness and catch regressions, and Javadoc for communicating the use of classes and methods.

* Organize and understand large multi-project codebases, creating build environments
using Gradle, Maven, or Ant.

## Python
* Use python to write quick scripts, larger applications, and web servers.

* Familiar with python idioms, code organization, and virtual environments. 
    
## Web Development
* Create practical and beautiful websites using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

* Use a variety of frontend tools and frameworks such as JQuery, React, ES6, Bootstrap,
THREE.js, and Webpack.
<!-- 
* Use web frameworks such as Flask, Ruby on Rails, Express, and Spark Java, or static site generators
such as Jekyll. -->

## Miscellaneous

* Varying experience with **other languages and frameworks** such as Ruby, C, C++,
assembly (MIPS and x86), Node.js, Rust, Elixir, and \LaTeX.

* Familiar with many **developer tools and services** such as git, vim, bash, IntelliJ, virtual machines, Linux systems,
GitHub, Heroku, and Continuous Integration (Travis).

# Experience

## **Center for Computational Research** - Internship (Paid)

May - August 2017

* Work with a senior researcher on developing tools for analyzing supercomputer job performance - [ubccr/SUPReMM](https://github.com/ubccr/supremm)

* Create a Python library for detecting and classifying periodic data, based on an algorithm described in a paper - [akofke/autoperiod](https://github.com/akofke/autoperiod)

* Use Python, MongoDB, and MySQL for data processing and visualization.

## **Etomica** - Java Molecular Simulation Framework - [github.com/etomica](https://github.com/etomica)

January 2017 - Present

* Suggest and oversee general improvements to Etomica development, including:
    * Migration of source code from CVS to git while keeping entire project history.
    * Conversion of ad-hoc manual build instructions into organized single repository with build system,
        inter-project and external dependencies managed by Gradle. 
    * Organize tests and set up continuous integration.
    * Ongoing refactoring and modernization of codebase.
  
* Develop web application frontend with Typescript, React, and WebGL for interactive viewing of simulations, along with Java server REST interface for Etomica.

* Teach and advise group of chemical engineering graduate students on software development best practices for use with Etomica, such as documentation, unit tests, version control with git and GitHub (branching, pull requests, issues), and Java coding patterns.

* Add functionality for importing and converting from common molecular simulation file formats.
